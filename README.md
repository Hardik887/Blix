# About the application

Blix is a clone of Netflix website built using React.JS as a Front-end & Firebase as Back-end.
<br></br>
It’s not a replica, and it doesn’t have all the features of Netflix website.
<br></br>
It’s a similar version of Netflix with my own design touch, showing my abilities in React.JS to build something advanced like Netflix.
<br></br>
It contains the home page, sign-in page, sign-up page, browse page, and movie player.
